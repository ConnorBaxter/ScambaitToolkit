# About Boo's libraries...
Yes, that's the name of the language. Anyways, if you try to compile yourself, you'll probably end up getting most of Boo's libraries 
along with the exe. However, do note that only the exe itself is required to run the resulting app unless you use features unique to Boo.
I don't use any (save for the amazingly simpler syntax), but I had to warn you in case you do modify my code.

* And what if I did?
You'll most likely only need Boo.Lang.dll and nothing else even if you do (or if for some obscure reason, my app doesn't work)
