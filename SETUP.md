This is mainly for Windows 7 as that is the VM I use for scambaiting. Im sure the procedure is similiar or identical for Windows 10.

# Netstat and Tree
1. Create a folder on the VM where you will store this projects versions of programs.
1. Click Start > Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
1. Find the PATH entry in the Systems Variables groupbox
1. Click edit
1. At the *start* of the path value box add the path of your created folder (Dont forget the ";" at the end)
1. Click OK / Apply on each window
1. Open up a CMD instance and test, if it doesnt work try again.
> *be careful using this - editing path can go wrong and trust me its annoying to fix*
