1. Syskey
  After setting a password the passwords are written to a textfile for inspection.
  Numerous popups with a message of your chosing(by editing settings.txt) are show which move as you try to hover over them
  They will dissapear after time set by the code (will be added to settings eventally)
  The amount of popups is determined based on the length of the password set
  Please note this is not actually syskey and wont lock the computer.
  SysKey is no longer in Windows 10 so scammers might not try to use on Windows 10 but will still appear to work if they do try.
  Reccommneded for Windows 7 virtual machines.
  
2. Notepad
  Still in development.
