All your file are belong to us.

All of your files have been ecrypted using RSA-2048 encryption and then ran through our homemade encryption algoritm to stop them every being recoverd.
However we are not awful people and as such have decided to let you use your computer as normal.
Every 20 minutes a new file will be ecrypted.
Eventually all your files will be unrecoverable.
To stop this process and recover all past files, we ask for a small donation of $570 to the below bitcoin address.
We have also stopped you from copying files from the PC to another so you cannot make backups.
All system restore points have been kurupted so you cannot restore this machine.
We have also forwared all saved logins and cookies to our command and control server.
We will not use this credentials if payment is made, however after lack of payment will will use these.

Thank you for your time and files.
